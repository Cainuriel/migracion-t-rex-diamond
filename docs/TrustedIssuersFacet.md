# TrustedIssuersFacet Documentation

## Overview

The `TrustedIssuersFacet` manages the **trusted claim issuer ecosystem** for the T-REX security token system. This facet maintains a registry of authorized identity claim issuers, associating them with specific claim topics to create a flexible, multi-issuer verification infrastructure.

## Architecture & Purpose

### Primary Responsibilities
- **Issuer Registry Management**: Add, remove, and query trusted claim issuers
- **Topic-Issuer Mapping**: Associate issuers with specific claim topics
- **Verification Authority Control**: Define who can issue valid identity claims
- **Multi-Issuer Support**: Enable multiple issuers per claim topic
- **Decentralized Trust**: Support distributed verification ecosystems

### Trust Model
The TrustedIssuersFacet implements a **delegated trust system**:
- **Token Issuer**: Ultimate authority over which claim issuers to trust
- **Claim Issuers**: Authorized third parties that verify investor identities
- **Topic Specialization**: Issuers can be specialized for specific claim types
- **Redundancy**: Multiple issuers per topic provide resilience and choice

## Storage Integration

Uses `AppStorage.trustedIssuers` mapping:
```solidity
struct AppStorage {
    mapping(uint256 => address[]) trustedIssuers;  // topic => issuer addresses
    // ... other storage fields
}
```

The trusted issuers integrate with:
- **ClaimTopicsFacet**: Topics define what issuers are needed
- **IdentityFacet**: Uses trusted issuers for claim validation
- **OnChain-ID Ecosystem**: Works with IClaimIssuer interface

## Key Functions

### Administrative Functions (Owner Only)

#### Add Trusted Issuer
```solidity
function addTrustedIssuer(address issuer, uint256[] calldata topics) external onlyOwner
```
- **Purpose**: Authorize a new claim issuer for specific topics
- **Parameters**:
  - `issuer`: Address of the claim issuer contract
  - `topics`: Array of claim topics the issuer is authorized for
- **Current Implementation**: Simplified to add issuer to first topic only
- **Event**: Emits `TrustedIssuerAdded(issuer, topics)`
- **Usage**: Onboard new KYC/AML providers

#### Remove Trusted Issuer
```solidity
function removeTrustedIssuer(address issuer, uint256 topic) external onlyOwner
```
- **Purpose**: Revoke authorization for a claim issuer on specific topic
- **Parameters**:
  - `issuer`: Address of the issuer to remove
  - `topic`: Specific claim topic to remove authorization for
- **Process**: 
  1. Locates issuer in topic's issuer array
  2. Replaces with last element (gas optimization)
  3. Removes last element with `pop()`
- **Event**: Emits `TrustedIssuerRemoved(issuer)`
- **Usage**: Remove compromised or deprecated issuers

### Query Functions

#### Get Trusted Issuers
```solidity
function getTrustedIssuers(uint256 topic) external view returns (address[] memory)
```
- **Purpose**: Return all trusted issuers for a specific claim topic
- **Parameter**: `topic` - The claim topic ID to query
- **Returns**: Array of authorized issuer addresses
- **Usage**: Used by IdentityFacet for claim validation
- **Integration**: Enables external systems to discover issuers

## Integration with T-REX System

### IdentityFacet Integration
The `isVerified()` function uses trusted issuers for validation:
```solidity
function isVerified(address user) public view returns (bool) {
    // For each required claim topic
    for (uint i = 0; i < s.claimTopics.length; i++) {
        uint256 topic = s.claimTopics[i];
        address[] memory issuers = s.trustedIssuers[topic];
        
        // Check claims from trusted issuers
        for (uint j = 0; j < issuers.length; j++) {
            // Validate claim from issuer...
            if (validClaimFromTrustedIssuer) {
                validClaim = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!validClaim) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### ClaimTopicsFacet Coordination
- Claim topics define what issuers are needed
- Each topic can have multiple trusted issuers
- Topic addition/removal affects issuer requirements
- Flexible compliance through topic-issuer combinations

### OnChain-ID Integration
Works with the OnChain-ID ecosystem:
- **IClaimIssuer Interface**: Validates claim signatures
- **Identity Contracts**: Stores claims from trusted issuers
- **Verification Process**: Cryptographic validation of claim authenticity
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central verification authority

## Events

```solidity
event TrustedIssuerAdded(address indexed issuer, uint256[] claimTopics);
event TrustedIssuerRemoved(address indexed issuer);
```

### Event Usage
- **Trust Changes**: Monitor additions/removals of trusted parties
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain regulatory compliance records
- **System Integration**: Trigger updates in external systems
- **Transparency**: Public visibility of trust relationships

## Access Control

### Owner-Only Administration
- All modification functions restricted to contract owner
- Prevents unauthorized trust relationship changes
- Ensures only token issuer controls verification ecosystem
- Maintains security and compliance integrity

### Public Query Access
- `getTrustedIssuers()` is publicly accessible
- Enables transparency in trust relationships
- Supports external system integration
- Allows verification of issuer authorization

## Trust Ecosystem Models

### 1. Single Issuer Model
```solidity
// Simple KYC setup with one provider
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(kycProviderAddress, [1, 2]); // KYC + AML
```

### 2. Multi-Issuer Model
```solidity
// Multiple providers for redundancy
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(kycProvider1, [1]);    // KYC
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(kycProvider2, [1]);    // Alternative KYC
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(amlProvider, [2]);     // Specialized AML
```

### 3. Specialized Issuer Model
```solidity
// Topic-specific specialization
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(kycSpecialist, [1]);       // KYC only
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(amlSpecialist, [2]);       // AML only
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(accreditationCheck, [3]);  // Accreditation only
```

### 4. Geographic Model
```solidity
// Region-specific issuers
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(usKycProvider, [1]);    // US KYC
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(euKycProvider, [1]);    // EU KYC
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(asiaKycProvider, [1]);  // Asia KYC
```

## Operational Patterns

### 1. Initial Ecosystem Setup
```solidity
// Primary KYC/AML provider
address[] memory kycTopics = new address[](2);
kycTopics[0] = 1; // KYC
kycTopics[1] = 2; // AML
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(primaryKycProvider, kycTopics);

// Backup KYC provider
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(backupKycProvider, [1]);
```

### 2. Issuer Rotation
```solidity
// Remove compromised issuer
trustedIssuersFacet.removeTrustedIssuer(compromisedIssuer, 1);

// Add replacement issuer
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(replacementIssuer, [1]);
```

### 3. Ecosystem Expansion
```solidity
// Add specialized issuer
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(accreditationProvider, [3]);

// Add regional issuer
trustedIssuersFacet.addTrustedIssuer(localKycProvider, [1, 10]);
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only owner can modify trusted issuer list
- Prevents unauthorized trust relationship changes
- Maintains control over verification ecosystem
- Clear audit trail through events

### Trust Validation
- Issuers must implement IClaimIssuer interface correctly
- Cryptographic signature validation prevents claim forgery
- Multiple issuers provide redundancy against failure
- Regular review of issuer performance recommended

### Ecosystem Security
- Compromise of one issuer doesn't break entire system
- Ability to quickly remove problematic issuers
- Multiple validation paths increase security
- OnChain-ID provides cryptographic guarantees

## Gas Optimization Considerations

### Array Management
- **Removal Optimization**: Swap-and-pop pattern for gas efficiency
- **Query Efficiency**: Single storage read per topic
- **Batch Operations**: Consider batching for multiple changes

### Scaling Considerations
- Performance with large issuer lists
- Consider issuer limits per topic
- Monitor gas usage as ecosystem grows
- Alternative architectures for very large deployments

## Implementation Notes

### Current Simplification
The current implementation has a simplification:
```solidity
s.trustedIssuers[topics[0]].push(issuer); // Only adds to first topic
```

### Enhanced Implementation
A full implementation would:
```solidity
function addTrustedIssuer(address issuer, uint256[] calldata topics) external onlyOwner {
    AppStorage storage s = LibAppStorage.diamondStorage();
    for (uint i = 0; i < topics.length; i++) {
        s.trustedIssuers[topics[i]].push(issuer);
    }
    emit TrustedIssuerAdded(issuer, topics);
}
```

## Regulatory Compliance

### Multi-Jurisdiction Support
- Different issuers for different jurisdictions
- Specialized compliance for local regulations
- Flexible trust relationships support global tokens
